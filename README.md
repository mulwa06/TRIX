# TRIX

Trix is your simple desktop browser.

I built it as my first successful WPF C# application. It has a very beautiful UI interface that is very unique and transformative for any user. It is also powered by WebView2, which is a Microsoft web browser engine that makes the application more secure for use. I have made a release of this application in my GitHub and I would love for anyone to feel free and use it. 

This was a personal project and it helped me learn how to build desktop applications with WPF. I gained a lot of experience from using this framework (WPF) and I loved using it ever since in building windows applications.

## Features

This project included the following features:
- .NET 6.0 Framework
- C#
